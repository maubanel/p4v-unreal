Notice that the .p4ignore and setconfig.bat are checked into the project as they have a small green check mark.  Notice that the **.p4config** file does not have a green checkmark.  That is becuase the `.p4ignore` file is stopping that file from being uploaded to the depot and being shared with other users.
