Tips for Perforce User with *Write* Access for Unreal Engine

<br>

---

## Workspace

- For command line access make sure you have rights to the repo by setting the user with: `p4 set P4USER=xrlab`

- Also, you will need to set the password: `p4 set P4PASSWD=XR1001Studio`

- Include your lsu username in your workspace name so that we do not accidentally delete it.



- To add multiple files it is best to do this in **P4V** and not in **Unreal**.  Click on the folder that you would like for it to mark all unadded files to include (minus the ones indicated in .p4ignre) and select `Reconcile Offline Work`. Make sure your '.p4 ignore' is up to date!
