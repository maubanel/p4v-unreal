<sub>[home](../README.md#user-content-p4v)</sub>

If you have a project set up you just need to set-up your [Workspace](https://github.com/maubanel/p4v-unreal/blob/main/workspaces/README.md#user-content-workspaces-in-p4v) and you are ready to go.  This guide is for setting up Unreal for Perforce for the VERY first time use. Only one person on the team needs to do this.  Everyone else will just press <kbd>Get Latest</kbd> to get all the work done here.

##### `Step 1.`\|`P4VUE5`|:small_blue_diamond:

First make sure you have access to a valid depot for your project.  A depot can contain as many Unreal projects as you like.  Talk to your teacher to get one made for your team.

##### `Step 2.`\|`P4VUE5`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Pick the appropriate template to start with.  You **HAVE** to put it in the same directory as the name of the depot and the folder within it as to be the same as the depot. So in this case my depot is `//New_Project/`, and the location of the depot is in `C\p4\`.  So I place the project in `C:\p4\New_Project\`.  I then name the project and press the <kbd>Create</kbd> button.

Now in the future if you boot up **Unreal** and it is saying it is connected to source control you can put your cursor on top and it will pop up to make sure you have the correct settings.

Open up **Epic Games Launcer** and run **Unreal Engine 5.0.X.**
